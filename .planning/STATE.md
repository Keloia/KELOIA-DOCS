# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** When a markdown or JSON file changes, both humans (via the site) and AI tools (via MCP) see the update immediately — no build pipeline, no deploy step, no sync.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone (MCP server)

## Current Position

Phase: v1.0 complete (Phases 1-2 shipped)
Next: Phase 3 — MCP Foundation
Status: Milestone v1.0 archived
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — v1.0 milestone completed and archived

Progress: [████████████████████] 100% (v1.0)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
