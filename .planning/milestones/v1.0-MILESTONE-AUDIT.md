# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 (Data Layer + Static Site)
**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** tech_debt
**Phases:** 2/2 complete (01-data-layer, 02-static-site)

## Requirements Coverage

### 3-Source Cross-Reference

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| DATA-01 | Seed docs/ with markdown files | passed (SATISFIED) | listed (01-01) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DATA-02 | Create kanban JSON schema | passed (SATISFIED) | listed (01-01) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DATA-03 | Create progress JSON schema | passed (SATISFIED) | listed (01-01) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DATA-04 | Add schemaVersion: 1 | passed (SATISFIED) | listed (01-01) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| SITE-01 | SPA shell with sidebar nav | passed (SATISFIED) | **missing** | [x] Complete | **partial** |
| SITE-02 | Markdown rendering + DOMPurify | passed (SATISFIED) | **missing** | [x] Complete | **partial** |
| SITE-03 | Kanban board with color-coding | passed (SATISFIED) | listed (02-02) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| SITE-04 | Progress tracker with bars | passed (SATISFIED) | listed (02-02) | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| SITE-05 | Dark theme + responsive layout | passed (SATISFIED) | **missing** | [x] Complete | **partial** |
| SITE-06 | Active sidebar highlighting | passed (SATISFIED) | **missing** | [x] Complete | **partial** |
| SITE-07 | Relative fetch paths | passed (SATISFIED) | **missing** | [x] Complete | **partial** |
| SITE-08 | GitHub Actions deploy | passed (SATISFIED) | **missing** | [x] Complete | **partial** |

**Satisfied:** 6/12 (full 3-source agreement)
**Partial:** 6/12 (verified + checked but missing from SUMMARY frontmatter)
**Unsatisfied:** 0/12
**Orphaned:** 0/12

### Partial Requirements Explanation

Six requirements (SITE-01, SITE-02, SITE-05, SITE-06, SITE-07, SITE-08) are marked "partial" because `02-01-SUMMARY.md` does not include a `requirements-completed` frontmatter field. The phase VERIFICATION.md has detailed evidence confirming all six are fully implemented. The gap is in SUMMARY documentation only — not in implementation.

### Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements. All 12 milestone REQ-IDs appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md requirements table.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Critical Gaps | Tech Debt Items |
|-------|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 01-data-layer | passed | 5/5 truths | None | None |
| 02-static-site | human_needed | 9/9 truths | None | 8 human verification items, SUMMARY frontmatter gap |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Checker verdict:** All wiring connected, no broken flows.

| From (Phase 1) | To (Phase 2) | Via | Status |
|-----------------|--------------|-----|--------|
| data/docs/*.md | app.js:renderDoc() | fetch('data/docs/${slug}.md') | WIRED |
| data/docs/index.json | app.js:populateDocList() | fetch('data/docs/index.json') | WIRED |
| data/kanban/index.json | app.js:renderKanban() | fetch('data/kanban/index.json') | WIRED |
| data/kanban/task-*.json | app.js:renderKanban() | Promise.all fan-out | WIRED |
| data/progress/index.json | app.js:renderProgress() | fetch('data/progress/index.json') | WIRED |
| data/progress/milestone-*.json | app.js:renderProgress() | Promise.all fan-out | WIRED |
| .nojekyll | GitHub Pages | Prevents Jekyll processing | WIRED |

**Note:** DATA-04 (schemaVersion) field is present in data files but not consumed by Phase 2 — designed for Phase 3 (MCP server). Not an integration gap for this milestone.

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Default doc load | User opens site → sidebar populates → architecture.md renders | COMPLETE |
| Doc navigation | User clicks doc link → correct markdown renders → active link updates | COMPLETE |
| Kanban view | User clicks Kanban → columns render with color-coded cards | COMPLETE |
| Progress view | User clicks Progress → milestones render with computed progress bars | COMPLETE |

**4/4 flows complete.** No broken flows detected.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 02: Static Site

1. **SUMMARY frontmatter gap** — `02-01-SUMMARY.md` missing `requirements-completed` field for SITE-01, SITE-02, SITE-05, SITE-06, SITE-07, SITE-08
2. **Stale seed data** — `milestone-01.json` shows `status: "in-progress"` / `tasksCompleted: 0` but Phase 1 is complete
3. **Stale seed data** — `milestone-02.json` shows `status: "pending"` / `tasksTotal: 0` but Phase 2 is complete
4. **Stale seed data** — All 4 kanban tasks remain in `"column": "Backlog"` despite being completed work
5. **Manual setup** — GitHub Pages source must be set to "GitHub Actions" in repository Settings > Pages (one-time, documented in 02-01-SUMMARY.md)
6. **Human verification** — 8 browser-level visual checks pending (dark theme, doc rendering, kanban colors, progress bars, active nav, network paths, responsive layout, console errors)

**Total: 6 items across 1 phase**

### Assessment

All tech debt items are non-blocking:
- Items 1-4 are documentation/data maintenance — the rendering code is correct
- Item 5 is a one-time manual step already documented
- Item 6 is standard for static site verification and the automated evidence strongly suggests pass
