# Milestone v1.1: MCP Server — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** passed
**Phases:** 2/2 complete (Phase 3: MCP Foundation, Phase 4: Read Tools)

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

All 12 milestone requirements verified across VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY frontmatter, and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table.

| Requirement | Description | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| MCP-01 | Server skeleton with SDK, zod, TypeScript, Node16 | Phase 3: SATISFIED | 03-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| MCP-02 | Stdio transport, zero console.log | Phase 3: SATISFIED | 03-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| MCP-03 | Paths from import.meta.url, never process.cwd | Phase 3: SATISFIED | 03-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| MCP-04 | .mcp.json at repo root | Phase 3: SATISFIED | 03-02: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| MCP-05 | Swappable transport layer | Phase 3: SATISFIED | 03-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| READ-01 | keloia_list_docs returns doc filenames | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| READ-02 | keloia_read_doc with pagination | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| READ-03 | keloia_get_kanban denormalized board | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| READ-04 | keloia_get_progress milestones | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| READ-05 | isError:true for invalid inputs | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| INTG-01 | keloia_ prefix on all tools | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |
| INTG-02 | Action-first tool descriptions | Phase 4: SATISFIED | 04-01: listed | `[x]` Complete | satisfied |

**Orphaned requirements:** None — all 12 requirements assigned to Phases 3-4 are accounted for in all three sources.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Human Items | Gaps |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|------|
| 3: MCP Foundation | passed | 5/5 | 1 (Claude Code /mcp status — user approved) | None |
| 4: Read Tools | passed (human_needed) | 7/7 | 5 (natural language tool selection — user approved) | None |

Both phases passed automated verification. Human verification items (Claude Code connection status, natural language tool selection) were approved by the project owner during plan execution checkpoints.

## Cross-Phase Integration

| # | Link | From | To | Status |
|---|------|------|----|--------|
| 1 | Entry point chain | index.ts | server.ts → read.ts | WIRED — createServer() calls registerReadTools(server) |
| 2 | Path resolution | read.ts | paths.ts | WIRED — imports DOCS_DIR, KANBAN_DIR, PROGRESS_DIR |
| 3 | Transport separation | index.ts | transport.ts (separate from server.ts) | WIRED — MCP-05 satisfied |
| 4 | Claude Code registration | .mcp.json | dist/index.js | WIRED — MCP-04 satisfied |
| 5 | Data layer access | read.ts | data/{docs,kanban,progress}/index.json | WIRED — all fan-out reads confirmed |

**Integration gaps:** None

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| List docs | Claude Code → keloia_list_docs → data/docs/index.json → JSON response | Verified (human-approved) |
| Read doc | Claude Code → keloia_read_doc → slug validation → data/docs/{slug}.md → markdown response | Verified (human-approved) |
| View kanban | Claude Code → keloia_get_kanban → data/kanban/index.json → fan-out to tasks → denormalized JSON | Verified (human-approved) |
| Check progress | Claude Code → keloia_get_progress → data/progress/index.json → fan-out to milestones → JSON | Verified (human-approved) |

**Broken flows:** None

## Anti-Patterns / Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 04-read-tools | `mcp-server/src/tools/write.ts` placeholder stub — Phase 5 fills this in | INFO (expected) |

No blockers. The single tech debt item is an intentional placeholder for the next milestone phase.

## Build Verification

`npm run build` in `mcp-server/` — zero TypeScript errors. All four tool names confirmed in compiled `dist/tools/read.js`.

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.1 (Phases 3-4) passes audit. All 12 requirements satisfied with evidence from 3 independent sources. Cross-phase integration verified — full chain from `.mcp.json` → `index.ts` → `server.ts` → `read.ts` → `paths.ts` → data files is wired and building. All 4 E2E user flows confirmed working in live Claude Code session.

Phase 5 (Write Tools + Integration) remains as the next phase to plan and execute.
