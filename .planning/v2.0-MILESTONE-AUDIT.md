## 3-Source Requirements Cross-Reference

### Satisfied Requirements (Phase 6)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| SRCH-01 | Search box at top of sidebar | SATISFIED | 06-01 ✓ | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| SRCH-02 | Live debounced search results | SATISFIED | 06-02 ✓ | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| SRCH-03 | Results show doc name + snippet | SATISFIED | 06-02 ✓ | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| SRCH-04 | Click result navigates to doc | SATISFIED | 06-02 ✓ | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| GUID-01 | MCP guide in site navigation | SATISFIED | 06-01 ✓ | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| GUID-02 | Guide with Cursor/Claude/Windsurf configs | SATISFIED | 06-01 ✓ | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

### Unsatisfied Requirements (Phases 7-11 — Not Started)

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| SRCH-05 | MCP keloia_search_docs tool | 7 | orphaned |
| SRCH-06 | MCP search slug filter | 7 | orphaned |
| CRUD-06 | MCP keloia_add_doc tool | 7 | orphaned |
| CRUD-07 | MCP keloia_edit_doc tool | 7 | orphaned |
| CRUD-08 | MCP keloia_delete_doc tool | 7 | orphaned |
| AUTH-01 | GitHub PAT entry | 8 | orphaned |
| AUTH-02 | Token localStorage persistence | 8 | orphaned |
| AUTH-03 | Logout clears token | 8 | orphaned |
| AUTH-04 | Write UI hidden when unauthenticated | 8 | orphaned |
| CRUD-05 | All writes through GitHub Contents API | 9 | orphaned |
| CRUD-01 | Create new doc | 10 | orphaned |
| CRUD-02 | Edit existing doc | 10 | orphaned |
| CRUD-03 | Toggle markdown preview | 10 | orphaned |
| CRUD-04 | Delete doc with confirmation | 10 | orphaned |
| KNBN-01 | Drag kanban cards between columns | 11 | orphaned |
| KNBN-02 | Confirmation modal before save | 11 | orphaned |
| KNBN-03 | Column change via GitHub API | 11 | orphaned |

**17 requirements orphaned** — assigned to phases in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table but phases have no directories, plans, or verification.

---

## Integration Check (Completed Scope)

Phase 6 internal integration: **fully wired**

- All 14 exports from plans 06-01 and 06-02 are consumed within Phase 6
- 0 orphaned exports, 0 broken flows, 0 missing connections
- 4 E2E flows verified: search docs, navigate to MCP guide, search state clearing, lazy index build

**Cross-phase integration:** N/A — only 1 phase complete, no cross-phase wiring to check.

**Notable finding (informational):** `mcp-guide` is accessible via the site at `#/docs/mcp-guide` but NOT via `keloia_read_doc` MCP tool (excluded from `index.json`). Intentional design decision — not a blocker.

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 06-site-search-guide | mcp-guide not accessible via keloia_read_doc MCP tool (cross-surface inconsistency) | Low |

**Total:** 1 item across 1 phase

---

## Remaining Work by Phase

| Phase | Requirements | Dependencies | Effort |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 7: MCP Search + Doc CRUD | SRCH-05, SRCH-06, CRUD-06, CRUD-07, CRUD-08 | None | Medium |
| 8: GitHub Auth | AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03, AUTH-04 | None | Medium |
| 9: GitHub API Wrapper | CRUD-05 | Phase 8 | Medium |
| 10: Site Doc CRUD | CRUD-01, CRUD-02, CRUD-03, CRUD-04 | Phase 8, Phase 9 | Large |
| 11: Interactive Kanban | KNBN-01, KNBN-02, KNBN-03 | Phase 8, Phase 9 | Medium |

**Critical path:** Phase 8 → Phase 9 → Phase 10/11 (auth must come before API wrapper, wrapper before write UIs)
